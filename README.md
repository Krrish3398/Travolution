* ABSTRACT
Each year, there are thousands of highway deaths and tens of thousands of serious injuries due to "Run-Off-Road" accidents. Everything from simple driver inattentiveness, to fatigue, callousness, to drunk driving, is responsible. Simple sensors can be fitted inside vehicles embedded with various features like, automatic collision notification, speed control which can give impetus to an efficient road safety system. The features that are proposed in this work are: Automatic collision notification that gives notification to the victim's relative,Speed control alters speed in different zones, Horn control prevents honking in horn prohibited zone, Alcohol detection detects drunk driving. The project and implementation presented here is a novel approach towards vehicle navigation and safety implementation. One can develop a system which will automatically sense such traffic signs automatically and accordingly control the vehicle speed or the horn forcibly in such zones. As the whole project and implementation is not just limited for these few functions, this project and implementation can be made mandatory. That way one can provide a more reliable security device and streamline traffic flow.
